I. DEFINITIONS

    1. "members meeting" shall also include annual meetings and
       general meetings.

II. MEMBERSHIP

A. Admittance to Membership

    1. The conditions under which membership will be issued are
       determined either by the Board, or by a Director, Officer,
       Member, or Committee appointed by the Board to oversee the
       issuance of membership.

    2. A person who has fulfilled the requirements of paragraph 1 may
       be admitted to membership by a resolution of the Board at a
       meeting duly called for that purpose. The Board must give
       notice to the "Members" mailing list at least five calendar
       days before the resolution is to be considered by the Board.

    3. A person admitted to membership by the Board of Directors shall
       have no privileges until their initial dues and first monthly
       dues are paid. The Board may by resolution set a schedule for
       pro-rated dues for the first month of membership, based on the
       date of the member's approval.

B. Dues

    1. The Board of Directors may by resolution set the dues for the
       corporation, which may be either or both of:

        (a) Initial dues, i.e. dues which are payable before a person
            can become a member;

        (b) Monthly dues, i.e. dues which are recurring and payable on
            the last day of each month (for the following month).

    2. If the Board passes a resolution which raises the initial or
       monthly dues by more than 10%, that resolution is effective
       only until confirmed at a general meeting of the Corporation
       duly called for that purpose. Such a meeting must be held
       within 30 days of the initial adoption of the resolution. If
       the resolution is not confirmed within 30 days, the resolution
       shall be rendered invalid.

C. Membership Hiatus

    1. A member may apply to the Board to have their membership placed
       on hiatus for a period of no less than two months. Such
       application must specify the start and end dates of the
       hiatus. The Board may approve a member's hiatus by resolution
       at meeting of the Board.

    2. During the time a member is on hiatus, they are not required to
       pay dues, nor shall they have any of the privileges afforded a
       member, except for the privilege of voting at members meetings
       called after the hiatus was requested.

    3. A member may voluntarily terminate their hiatus at any time by
       notifying the Board of Directors they wish to do so and paying
       their monthly dues for the current month. No discounts shall be
       given for partial months.
